                                <p>YASH TOOLS was founded on the principle of working together with our
                                    customers to fully understand your individual applications and needs and making

                                <p>Today most companies are facing ever increasing pressure to reduce costs and improve
                                    productivity. Reducing costs goes beyond the simple cost of acquisition of tools,
                                    equipments and other supplies. We need to look at the Total Cost of Production.
                                    Focusing solely on the basic cost of acquisition is doomed to failure.
                                </p>
                                <p>Reducing the Total Cost of Production requires examining many factors such as the
                                    tools, machines, technology, processes, operator training and methods. To achieve
                                    the goal of reducing the Total Cost of Production we need the cooperation of the
                                    entire team from purchasing, engineering, operators and suppliers.
                                </p>
